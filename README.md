All Labs done on Replit and in Java

Biggest project was HeartsGamePlayer. I developed a virtual player in Java for the card game Hearts and an algorithm to efficiently play the game against a human opponent. Honed object-oriented programming skills while working collaboratively to debug and refine the player algorithm.
